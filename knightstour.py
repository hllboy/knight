# This program implements a brute-force solution for the Knight's tour problem
# using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The Knight's tour is a chessboard
# puzzle in which the objective is to find a sequence of moves by the knight in
# which it visits every square on the board exactly one. It uses a 6x6 array for
# the chessboard where each square is identified by a row and column index, the
# range of which both start at 0. Let the upper-left square of the board be the
# row 0 and column 0 square.
#
# Imports the necessary modules.
 
# Main driver function which starts the recursion.
